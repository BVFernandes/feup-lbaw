The purpose of this project is to develop a web application for an online tech store. In order to have a great product diversity, the store sells multiple tech brands and product types, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets.

The evolution of technology is inevitable and has been growing exponentially. In addition, people seek devices to aid them in their everyday life, molding complex tasks into simple ones. It would be useful to have an application that grants users an easy method to purchase products with the tech specs they desire.

The platform will have an adaptive design and a detailed navigation system by arranging the products through categories. Each product will have tags that will allow the user to quickly find what he needs through the search bar. In order to provide a reliable service, each product will also have a review section, which will allow users to not only review the items they purchased but also to view other people's opinions. Besides, users will have the ability to keep lists of favorite products and view the history of all previous purchases.

Users will be distributed in three groups with different permissions: visitors, registered users, and administrators. A visitor will only be able to navigate through the website. A registered user will have privileges not only to make purchases and review items but also to assemble lists and manage their personal information. Finally, an administrator will have all the privileges of access and modification.
