# A3: User Interface Prototype


This user interfaces prototype(or horizontal prototype) has the following goals:

1. Help to identify and describe the user requirements, and raise new ones;
2. Preview and empirically test the user interface of the product to be developed;
3. Enable quick and multiple iterations on the design of the user interface.

This artefact includes three elements:

1. Overview of the interface elements and features common to all pages;
2. Overview of the information system from the viewpoint of the users(sitemap);
3. Identification and description of the main interactions with the system, organized as sequences of screens (storyboards).

The interface's descriptions are presented on the end of the document.

## 1.Interface and common features

Sweven is a web application based on HTML5,JavaScript and CSS. The user interface was implemented using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

Figure 1:Interface's guidelines

1. Shop name
2. Navbar
3. Page Content
4. Footer

In this figure some characteristics common to all pages are highlighted:

* We opted for a web design to have a flowing web page layout that suits most screen sizes and resolutions, since a 15'' laptop to a 4'' smartphone.
* The common links and buttons to the various pages (links of footer and buttons of the navbar) mantain their position to make a consistent user experience.

## 2.Sitemap

A sitemap is a visual representation of the relationship between the different pages of a website that shows how all the information fits together.

The sitemap gives the project team an idea of how the website is going to be build by helping to clarify the information hierarchy.
