# A9: Main accesses to the database and transactions

This artefact shows the main accesses to the database, including the transactions.

For each transaction, the isolation level is explicitly stated and read-only transactions are identified to improve global performance. For each identified access, the SQL code and the reference of web resources (A7) are provided.
